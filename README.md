# NeuralNet
An implementation of a simple, single-layer neural network from scratch.

This is a simple neural network with one hidden layer. The number of hidden units is specified as a parameter. The network uses a sigmoid activation function for the hidden layer, and a softmax function for the output. 

The program can be called from the command line with the following arguments:
1) training input file directory
2) validation input file directory
3) training output file directory (for predicted labels on the training dataset)
4) validation output file directory (for predicted labels on the validation dataset)
5) metrics output file directory (for model metrics output)
6) number of epochs
7) number of hidden units
8) init_flag (1 for random weights initialization; 2 for zero initialization)
9) learning rate
